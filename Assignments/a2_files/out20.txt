CHAPTER                                                                      XVI

OF                                                                         GLORY

There is the name and the thing: the name is a voice which denotes and signifies
the  thing;  the  name  is  no  part  of the thing, nor of the substance; 'tis a
foreign  piece  joined  to the thing, and outside it. God, who is all fulness in
Himself  and  the  height  of  all perfection, cannot augment or add anything to
Himself  within; but His name may be augmented and increased by the blessing and
praise  we  attribute  to  His  exterior  works:  which praise, seeing we cannot
incorporate  it  in  Him,  forasmuch  as  He  can  have no accession of good, we
attribute  to His name, which is the part out of Him that is nearest to us. Thus
is  it  that  to  God  alone glory and honour appertain; and there is nothing so
remote from reason as that we should go in quest of it for ourselves; for, being
indigent  and  necessitous  within,  our  essence  being  imperfect,  and having
continual  need  of  amelioration,  'tis  to  that  we  ought  to employ all our
endeavour. We are all hollow and empty; 'tis not with wind and voice that we are
to  fill  ourselves; we want a more solid substance to repair us: a man starving
with  hunger  would  be very simple to seek rather to provide himself with a gay
garment  than  with  a good meal: we are to look after that whereof we have most
need.      As      we      have      it     in     our     ordinary     prayers:

          "Gloria    in    excelsis   Deo,   et   in   terra   pax   hominibus."

We  are  in  want  of  beauty,  health,  wisdom, virtue, and such like essential
qualities:  exterior  ornaments  should,  be  looked  after  when  we  have made
provision  for  necessary  things. Divinity treats amply and more pertinently of
this     subject,     but     I     am     not     much     versed     in    it.

Chrysippus  and Diogenes were the earliest and firmest advocates of the contempt
of  glory;  and  maintained  that,  amongst  all  pleasures, there was none more
dangerous  nor  more to be avoided than that which proceeds from the approbation
of  others.  And,  in  truth,  experience makes us sensible of many very hurtful
treasons  in  it.  There  is  nothing  that  so poisons princes as flattery, nor
anything  whereby wicked men more easily obtain credit and favour with them; nor
panderism  so apt and so usually made use of to corrupt the chastity of women as
to wheedle and entertain them with their own praises. The first charm the Syrens
made     use     of     to     allure     Ulysses    is    of    this    nature:

          "Deca vers nous, deca, o tres-louable Ulysse, Et le plus grand honneur
          don't                la                Grece               fleurisse."

     ["Come  hither  to  us,  O  admirable  Ulysses,  come hither, thou greatest
     ornament    and    pride   of   Greece."--Homer,   Odysseus,   xii.   184.]

These  philosophers  said,  that  all  the  glory  of the world was not worth an
understanding    man's    holding    out    his    finger    to    obtain    it:

 "Gloria     quantalibet     quid     erit,     si     gloria    tantum    est?"

["What  is  glory,  be  it  as  glorious  as  it  may  be, if it be no more than
glory?"--Juvenal,                 Sat.,                 vii.                81.]

I  say  for it alone; for it often brings several commodities along with it, for
which  it  may  justly be desired: it acquires us good-will, and renders us less
subject and exposed to insult and offence from others, and the like. It was also
one  of  the  principal  doctrines  of  Epicurus;  for this precept of his sect,
Conceal   thy  life,  that  forbids  men  to  encumber  themselves  with  public
negotiations  and  offices,  also  necessarily  presupposes a contempt of glory,
which   is   the   world's   approbation   of   those   actions  we  produce  in
public.--[Plutarch,  Whether  the  saying,  Conceal thy life, is well said.]--He
that  bids us conceal ourselves, and to have no other concern but for ourselves,
and  who  will not have us known to others, would much less have us honoured and
glorified;  and  so advises Idomeneus not in any sort to regulate his actions by
the  common  reputation  or  opinion, except so as to avoid the other accidental
inconveniences    that   the   contempt   of   men   might   bring   upon   him.

These  discourses are, in my opinion, very true and rational; but we are, I know
not  how, double in ourselves, which is the cause that what we believe we do not
believe,  and  cannot  disengage  ourselves from what we condemn. Let us see the
last  and  dying  words  of  Epicurus;  they  are  grand,  and  worthy of such a
philosopher,  and  yet they carry some touches of the recommendation of his name
and  of  that  humour  he  had decried by his precepts. Here is a letter that he
dictated        a        little        before        his        last       gasp:

                              "EPICUYUS        TO       HEYMACHUS,       health.

     "Whilst I was passing over the happy and last day of my life, I write this,
     but,  at  the  same time, afflicted with such pain in my bladder and bowels
     that  nothing  can be greater, but it was recompensed with the pleasure the
     remembrance  of my inventions and doctrines brought to my soul. Now, as the
     affection  thou  hast ever from thy infancy borne towards me and philosophy
     requires,   take   upon  thee  the  protection  of  Metrodorus'  children."

This  is the letter. And that which makes me interpret that the pleasure he says
he  had  in  his  soul  concerning  his  inventions,  has  some reference to the
reputation  he  hoped  for thence after his death, is the manner of his will, in
which  he  gives order that Amynomachus and Timocrates, his heirs, should, every
January,  defray  the  expense  of  the celebration of his birthday as Hermachus
should  appoint; and also the expense that should be made the twentieth of every
moon  in  entertaining  the  philosophers,  his  friends, who should assemble in
honour  of  the  memory of him and of Metrodorus.--[Cicero, De Finibus, ii. 30.]

Carneades  was head of the contrary opinion, and maintained that glory was to be
desired  for  itself,  even  as  we embrace our posthumous issue for themselves,
having no knowledge nor enjoyment of them. This opinion has not failed to be the
more  universally  followed, as those commonly are that are most suitable to our
inclinations.  Aristotle  gives  it  the first place amongst external goods; and
avoids,  as  too  extreme  vices, the immoderate either seeking or evading it. I
believe  that,  if  we  had  the books Cicero wrote upon this subject, we should
there  find  pretty stories; for he was so possessed with this passion, that, if
he had dared, I think he could willingly have fallen into the excess that others
did,  that  virtue  itself  was  not  to be coveted, but upon the account of the
honour              that              always             attends             it:

                              "Paulum  sepultae  distat inertiae Celata virtus:"

                    ["Virtue   concealed   little   differs  from  dead  sloth."
                    --Horace,          Od.,          iv.         9,         29.]

which  is  an  opinion  so  false,  that I am vexed it could ever enter into the
understanding  of  a  man  that  was  honoured  with  the  name  of philosopher.

If  this  were true, men need not be virtuous but in public; and we should be no
further  concerned to keep the operations of the soul, which is the true seat of
virtue,  regular  and  in  order, than as they are to arrive at the knowledge of
others.  Is there no more in it, then, but only slily and with circumspection to
do  ill?  "If  thou  knowest,"  says Carneades, "of a serpent lurking in a place
where,  without  suspicion,  a  person is going to sit down, by whose death thou
expectest  an  advantage, thou dost ill if thou dost not give him caution of his
danger;  and  so  much  the  more  because the action is to be known by none but
thyself."  If we do not take up of ourselves the rule of well-doing, if impunity
pass  with  us  for  justice, to how many sorts of wickedness shall we every day
abandon  ourselves?  I  do  not  find  what  Sextus  Peduceus did, in faithfully
restoring  the  treasure  that  C. Plotius had committed to his sole secrecy and
trust,  a thing that I have often done myself, so commendable, as I should think
it  an  execrable baseness, had we done otherwise; and I think it of good use in
our  days  to  recall  the example of P. Sextilius Rufus, whom Cicero accuses to
have  entered  upon  an  inheritance  contrary  to  his conscience, not only not
against  law,  but  even  by  the  determination  of the laws themselves; and M.
Crassus and Hortensius, who, by reason of their authority and power, having been
called  in by a stranger to share in the succession of a forged will, that so he
might  secure  his  own  part,  satisfied  themselves with having no hand in the
forgery,  and  refused  not  to make their advantage and to come in for a share:
secure  enough, if they could shroud themselves from accusations, witnesses, and
the               cognisance              of              the              laws:

          "Meminerint  Deum  se  habere  testem, id est (ut ego arbitror) mentem
          suam."

     ["Let  them consider they have God to witness, that is (as I interpret it),
     their     own     consciences."--Cicero,     De     Offic.,    iii.    10.]

Virtue  is  a very vain and frivolous thing if it derive its recommendation from
glory;  and 'tis to no purpose that we endeavour to give it a station by itself,
and  separate  it  from  fortune;  for  what is more accidental than reputation?

     "Profecto  fortuna  in omni re dominatur: ea res cunctas ex libidine magis,
     quhm           ex           vero,          celebrat,          obscuratque."

     ["Fortune rules in all things; it advances and depresses things more out of
     its  own  will  than  of  right  and  justice." --Sallust, Catilina, c. 8.]

So to order it that actions may be known and seen is purely the work of fortune;
'tis  chance that helps us to glory, according to its own temerity. I have often
seen  her go before merit, and often very much outstrip it. He who first likened
glory  to a shadow did better than he was aware of; they are both of them things
pre-eminently  vain  glory  also, like a shadow, goes sometimes before the body,
and  sometimes in length infinitely exceeds it. They who instruct gentlemen only
to     employ     their     valour     for     the    obtaining    of    honour:

          "Quasi    non    sit    honestum,    quod    nobilitatum   non   sit;"

          ["As  though  it  were  not  a  virtue, unless celebrated" --Cicero De
          Offic.                            iii.                            10.]

what  do  they intend by that but to instruct them never to hazard themselves if
they  are  not  seen,  and to observe well if there be witnesses present who may
carry  news  of their valour, whereas a thousand occasions of well-doing present
themselves  which  cannot  be taken notice of? How many brave individual actions
are  buried  in  the  crowd  of  a  battle? Whoever shall take upon him to watch
another's  behaviour  in  such  a  confusion  is  not very busy himself, and the
testimony  he  shall give of his companions' deportment will be evidence against
himself:

          "Vera  et sapiens animi magnitudo, honestum illud, quod maxime naturam
          sequitur,    in    factis    positum,   non   in   gloria,   judicat."

     ["The  true and wise magnanimity judges that the bravery which most follows
     nature  more  consists  in  act  than  glory."  --Cicero, De Offic. i. 19.]

All  the  glory that I pretend to derive from my life is that I have lived it in
quiet;  in quiet, not according to Metrodorus, or Arcesilaus, or Aristippus, but
according to myself. For seeing philosophy has not been able to find out any way
to  tranquillity  that  is  good in common, let every one seek it in particular.

To what do Caesar and Alexander owe the infinite grandeur of their renown but to
fortune?  How  many men has she extinguished in the beginning of their progress,
of  whom  we have no knowledge, who brought as much courage to the work as they,
if  their  adverse  hap  had  not cut them off in the first sally of their arms?
Amongst so many and so great dangers I do not remember I have anywhere read that
Caesar  was  ever wounded; a thousand have fallen in less dangers than the least
of  those he went through. An infinite number of brave actions must be performed
without  witness  and  lost, before one turns to account. A man is not always on
the  top of a breach, or at the head of an army, in the sight of his general, as
upon  a  scaffold;  a man is often surprised betwixt the hedge and the ditch; he
must  run  the  hazard  of  his  life  against a henroost; he must dislodge four
rascally  musketeers out of a barn; he must prick out single from his party, and
alone  make some attempts, according as necessity will have it. And whoever will
observe  will,  I  believe,  find  it experimentally true, that occasions of the
least  lustre are ever the most dangerous; and that in the wars of our own times
there  have  more  brave men been lost in occasions of little moment, and in the
dispute  about  some  little paltry fort, than in places of greatest importance,
and   where   their   valour   might   have   been   more  honourably  employed.

Who  thinks  his  death achieved to ill purpose if he do not fall on some signal
occasion,  instead  of  illustrating  his  death,  wilfully  obscures  his life,
suffering  in the meantime many very just occasions of hazarding himself to slip
out  of  his  hands;  and  every  just  one  is  illustrious enough, every man's
conscience       being       a       sufficient       trumpet       to      him.

          "Gloria     nostra     est    testimonium    conscientiae    nostrae."

     ["For   our   rejoicing   is   this,  the  testimony  of  our  conscience."
     --Corinthians,                            i.                            I.]

He  who  is  only a good man that men may know it, and that he may be the better
esteemed  when  'tis  known;  who  will  not do well but upon condition that his
virtue may be known to men: is one from whom much service is not to be expected:

              "Credo ch 'el reste di quel verno, cose
               Facesse degne di tener ne conto;
               Ma fur fin' a quel tempo si nascose,
               Che non a colpa mia s' hor 'non le conto
               Perche Orlando a far l'opre virtuose
               Piu ch'a narrar le poi sempre era pronto;
               Ne mai fu alcun' de'suoi fatti espresso,
               Se non quando ebbe i testimonii appresso."

     ["The  rest  of  the  winter,  I  believe,  was  spent in actions worthy of
     narration,  but  they were done so secretly that if I do not tell them I am
     not  to  blame, for Orlando was more bent to do great acts than to boast of
     them,  so  that  no  deeds  of  his  were  ever  known  but  those that had
     witnesses."--Ariosto,        Orlando        Furioso,        xi.        81.]

A  man  must  go  to the war upon the account of duty, and expect the recompense
that  never fails brave and worthy actions, how private soever, or even virtuous
thoughts-the  satisfaction that a well-disposed conscience receives in itself in
doing well. A man must be valiant for himself, and upon account of the advantage
it  is  to him to have his courage seated in a firm and secure place against the
assaults                               of                               fortune:

                   "Virtus, repulsaa nescia sordidx
                    Intaminatis fulget honoribus
                    Nec sumit, aut ponit secures
                    Arbitrio popularis aura."

     ["Virtue,  repudiating  all  base repulse, shines in taintless honours, nor
     takes  nor  leaves  dignity  at the mere will of the vulgar."--Horace, Od.,
     iii.                                 2,                                17.]

It  is not for outward show that the soul is to play its part, but for ourselves
within, where no eyes can pierce but our own; there she defends us from the fear
of  death,  of  pain, of shame itself: there she arms us against the loss of our
children, friends, and fortunes: and when opportunity presents itself, she leads
us          on          to          the          hazards         of         war:

          "Non    emolumento    aliquo,    sed    ipsius   honestatis   decore."

     ["Not  for  any profit, but for the honour of honesty itself." --Cicero, De
     Finib.,                               i.                               10.]

This  profit  is  of  much  greater advantage, and more worthy to be coveted and
hoped for, than, honour and glory, which are no other than a favourable judgment
given                                   of                                   us.

A dozen men must be called out of a whole nation to judge about an acre of land;
and  the  judgment  of our inclinations and actions, the most difficult and most
important matter that is, we refer to the voice and determination of the rabble,
the  mother  of ignorance, injustice, and inconstancy. Is it reasonable that the
life   of   a   wise   man   should   depend   upon   the   judgment  of  fools?

          "An  quidquam  stultius,  quam,  quos  singulos contemnas, eos aliquid
          putare                         esse                        universes?"

     ["Can anything be more foolish than to think that those you despise singly,
     can  be  anything  else  in  general."  --Cicero,  Tusc.  Quaes.,  v.  36.]

He  that  makes it his business to please them, will have enough to do and never
have   done;   'tis   a   mark   that   can   never   be   aimed   at   or  hit:

          "Nil    tam    inaestimabile    est,    quam    animi   multitudinis."

     ["Nothing   is   to   be   so   little  understood  as  the  minds  of  the
     multitude."--Livy,                        xxxi.                        34.]

Demetrius  pleasantly  said  of  the  voice  of the people, that he made no more
account  of  that  which  came from above than of that which came from below. He
[Cicero]                                says                               more:

          "Ego  hoc  judico,  si quando turpe non sit, tamen non esse non turpe,
          quum           id           a          multitudine          laudatur."

     ["I am of opinion, that though a thing be not foul in itself, yet it cannot
     but  become  so  when commended by the multitude." --Cicero, De Finib., ii.
     15.]

No art, no activity of wit, could conduct our steps so as to follow so wandering
and so irregular a guide; in this windy confusion of the noise of vulgar reports
and  opinions  that drive us on, no way worth anything can be chosen. Let us not
propose  to  ourselves so floating and wavering an end; let us follow constantly
after  reason; let the public approbation follow us there, if it will; and as it
wholly  depends upon fortune, we have no reason sooner to expect it by any other
way than that. Even though I would not follow the right way because it is right,
I  should, however, follow it as having experimentally found that, at the end of
the   reckoning,   'tis  commonly  the  most  happy  and  of  greatest  utility.

          "Dedit  hoc  providentia  hominibus munus, ut honesta magis juvarent."

     ["This  gift  Providence has given to men, that honest things should be the
     most      agreeable."--Quintilian,      Inst.      Orat.,      i.      12.]

The  mariner  of old said thus to Neptune, in a great tempest: "O God, thou wilt
save  me if thou wilt, and if thou choosest, thou wilt destroy me; but, however,
I  will hold my rudder straight."--[Seneca, Ep., 85.]-- I have seen in my time a
thousand  men  supple,  halfbred,  ambiguous,  whom  no  one  doubted to be more
worldly-wise   than   I,   lose   themselves,   where   I   have  saved  myself:

          "Risi          successus          posse         carere         dolos."

     ["I  have  laughed to see cunning fail of success." --Ovid, Heroid, i. 18.]

Paulus AEmilius, going on the glorious expedition of Macedonia, above all things
charged  the  people of Rome not to speak of his actions during his absence. Oh,
the  license  of judgments is a great disturbance to great affairs! forasmuch as
every  one has not the firmness of Fabius against common, adverse, and injurious
tongues,  who  rather suffered his authority to be dissected by the vain fancies
of  men, than to do less well in his charge with a favourable reputation and the
popular                                                                applause.

There  is I know not what natural sweetness in hearing one's self commended; but
we       are       a       great       deal       too      fond      of      it:

          "Laudari  metuam,  neque enim mihi cornea fibra est Sed recti finemque
          extremumque      esse     recuso     Euge     tuum,     et     belle."

     ["I should fear to be praised, for my heart is not made of horn; but I deny
     that   'excellent--admirably   done,'  are  the  terms  and  final  aim  of
     virtue."--Persius,                          i.                         47.]

I  care not so much what I am in the opinions of others, as what I am in my own;
I  would  be  rich  of  myself,  and not by borrowing. Strangers see nothing but
events  and  outward  appearances;  everybody can set a good face on the matter,
when  they  have trembling and terror within: they do not see my heart, they see
but  my  countenance. One is right in decrying the hypocrisy that is in war; for
what  is  more  easy to an old soldier than to shift in a time of danger, and to
counterfeit  the  brave  when  he has no more heart than a chicken? There are so
many ways to avoid hazarding a man's own person, that we have deceived the world
a  thousand  times before we come to be engaged in a real danger: and even then,
finding  ourselves  in  an  inevitable necessity of doing something, we can make
shift  for  that time to conceal our apprehensions by setting a good face on the
business, though the heart beats within; and whoever had the use of the Platonic
ring,  which  renders those invisible that wear it, if turned inward towards the
palm  of the hand, a great many would very often hide themselves when they ought
most  to  appear,  and  would repent being placed in so honourable a post, where
necessity              must              make             them             bold.

          "Falsus  honor  juvat,  et mendax infamia terret Quem nisi mendosum et
          mendacem?"

     ["False   honour  pleases,  and  calumny  affrights,  the  guilty  and  the
     sick."--Horace,            Ep.,            i.            16,           89.]

Thus  we  see  how all the judgments that are founded upon external appearances,
are  marvellously  uncertain  and  doubtful;  and  that  there  is no so certain
testimony  as  every  one  is  to himself. In these, how many soldiers' boys are
companions  of  our glory? he who stands firm in an open trench, what does he in
that  more  than  fifty  poor pioneers who open to him the way and cover it with
their    own    bodies    for    fivepence   a   day   pay,   do   before   him?

          "Non quicquid turbida Roma Elevet, accedas; examenque improbum in illa
          Castiges       trutina:      nec      to      quaesiveris      extra."

     ["Do not, if turbulent Rome disparage anything, accede; nor correct a false
     balance  by that scale; nor seek anything beyond thyself." --Persius, Sat.,
     i.                                                                      5.]

THE  DISPERSING  AND  SCATTERING OUR NAMES INTO MANY MOUTHS, WE CALL MAKING THEM
MORE  GREAT;  WE WILL HAVE THEM THERE WELL RECEIVED, AND THAT THIS INCREASE TURN
TO  THEIR  ADVANTAGE, WHICH IS ALL THAT CAN BE EXCUSABLE IN THIS DESIGN. BUT THE
EXCESS  OF  THIS  DISEASE  PROCEEDS SO FAR THAT MANY COVET TO HAVE A NAME, BE IT
WHAT  IT  WILL. TROGUS POMPEIUS SAYS OF HEROSTRATUS, AND TITUS LIVIUS OF MANLIUS
CAPITOLINUS,  THAT THEY WERE MORE AMBITIOUS OF A GREAT REPUTATION THAN OF A GOOD
ONE.  THIS IS VERY COMMON; WE ARE MORE SOLICITOUS THAT MEN SPEAK OF US, THAN HOW
THEY  SPEAK;  AND  IT IS ENOUGH FOR US THAT OUR NAMES ARE OFTEN MENTIONED, BE IT
AFTER  WHAT  MANNER IT WILL. IT SHOULD SEEM THAT TO BE KNOWN, IS IN SOME SORT TO
HAVE A MAN'S LIFE AND ITS DURATION IN OTHERS' KEEPING. I, FOR MY PART, HOLD THAT
I  AM  NOT,  BUT  IN  MYSELF;  AND  OF THAT OTHER LIFE OF MINE WHICH LIES IN THE
KNOWLEDGE  OF MY FRIENDS, TO CONSIDER IT NAKED AND SIMPLY IN ITSELF, I KNOW VERY
WELL THAT I AM SENSIBLE OF NO FRUIT NOR ENJOYMENT FROM IT BUT BY THE VANITY OF A
FANTASTIC  OPINION;  AND  WHEN  I  SHALL BE DEAD, I SHALL BE STILL AND MUCH LESS
SENSIBLE  OF  IT;  AND  SHALL,  WITHAL,  ABSOLUTELY  LOSE  THE USE OF THOSE REAL
ADVANTAGES        THAT       SOMETIMES       ACCIDENTALLY       FOLLOW       IT.

I SHALL HAVE NO MORE HANDLE WHEREBY TO TAKE HOLD OF REPUTATION, NEITHER SHALL IT
HAVE  ANY WHEREBY TO TAKE HOLD OF OR TO CLEAVE TO ME; FOR TO EXPECT THAT MY NAME
SHOULD  BE  ADVANCED BY IT, IN THE FIRST PLACE, I HAVE NO NAME THAT IS ENOUGH MY
OWN;  OF  TWO  THAT  I  HAVE, ONE IS COMMON TO ALL MY RACE, AND INDEED TO OTHERS
ALSO;  THERE  ARE  TWO  FAMILIES  AT  PARIS  AND  MONTPELLIER,  WHOSE SURNAME IS
MONTAIGNE,  ANOTHER  IN  BRITTANY,  AND  ONE  IN XAINTONGE, DE LA MONTAIGNE. THE
TRANSPOSITION OF ONE SYLLABLE ONLY WOULD SUFFICE SO TO RAVEL OUR AFFAIRS, THAT I
SHALL  SHARE IN THEIR GLORY, AND THEY PERADVENTURE WILL PARTAKE OF MY DISCREDIT;
AND,  MOREOVER,  MY  ANCESTORS HAVE FORMERLY BEEN SURNAMED, EYQUEM,--[EYQUEM WAS
THE  PATRONYMIC.]--A  NAME WHEREIN A FAMILY WELL KNOWN IN ENGLAND IS AT THIS DAY
CONCERNED.  AS  TO  MY  OTHER  NAME,  EVERY  ONE  MAY TAKE IT THAT WILL, AND SO,
PERHAPS,  I  MAY  HONOUR  A  PORTER IN MY OWN STEAD. AND BESIDES, THOUGH I HAD A
PARTICULAR  DISTINCTION  BY  MYSELF, WHAT CAN IT DISTINGUISH, WHEN I AM NO MORE?
CAN         IT         POINT        OUT        AND        FAVOUR        INANITY?

          "NON  LEVIOR  CIPPUS NUNC IMPRIMIT OSSA? LAUDAT POSTERITAS! NUNC NON E
          MANIBUS  ILLIS,  NUNC  NON  A  TUMULO  FORTUNATAQUE FAVILLA, NASCENTUR
          VIOLAE?"

     ["DOES  THE  TOMB PRESS WITH LESS WEIGHT UPON MY BONES? DO COMRADES PRAISE?
     NOT  FROM  MY  MANES,  NOT  FROM  THE TOMB, NOT FROM THE ASHES WILL VIOLETS
     GROW."--PERSIUS,                SAT.,                I.                37.]

BUT OF THIS I HAVE SPOKEN ELSEWHERE. AS TO WHAT REMAINS, IN A GREAT BATTLE WHERE
TEN  THOUSAND  MEN  ARE  MAIMED  OR  KILLED, THERE ARE NOT FIFTEEN WHO ARE TAKEN
NOTICE  OF; IT MUST BE SOME VERY EMINENT GREATNESS, OR SOME CONSEQUENCE OF GREAT
IMPORTANCE  THAT  FORTUNE HAS ADDED TO IT, THAT SIGNALISES A PRIVATE ACTION, NOT
OF  A  HARQUEBUSER  ONLY,  BUT OF A GREAT CAPTAIN; FOR TO KILL A MAN, OR TWO, OR
TEN:  TO  EXPOSE  A  MAN'S  SELF BRAVELY TO THE UTMOST PERIL OF DEATH, IS INDEED
SOMETHING  IN  EVERY ONE OF US, BECAUSE WE THERE HAZARD ALL; BUT FOR THE WORLD'S
CONCERN,  THEY  ARE  THINGS SO ORDINARY, AND SO MANY OF THEM ARE EVERY DAY SEEN,
AND  THERE  MUST OF NECESSITY BE SO MANY OF THE SAME KIND TO PRODUCE ANY NOTABLE
EFFECT,    THAT    WE   CANNOT   EXPECT   ANY   PARTICULAR   RENOWN   FROM   IT:

          "CASUS  MULTIS HIC COGNITUS, AC JAM TRITUS, ET A MEDIO FORTUNAE DUCTUS
          ACERVO."

     ["THE ACCIDENT IS KNOWN TO MANY, AND NOW TRITE; AND DRAWN FROM THE MIDST OF
     FORTUNE'S          HEAP."--JUVENAL,         SAT.,         XIII.         9.]

OF  SO  MANY THOUSANDS OF VALIANT MEN WHO HAVE DIED WITHIN THESE FIFTEEN HUNDRED
YEARS IN FRANCE WITH THEIR SWORDS IN THEIR HANDS, NOT A HUNDRED HAVE COME TO OUR
KNOWLEDGE. THE MEMORY, NOT OF THE COMMANDERS ONLY, BUT OF BATTLES AND VICTORIES,
IS  BURIED  AND  GONE;  THE  FORTUNES  OF ABOVE HALF OF THE WORLD, FOR WANT OF A
RECORD, STIR NOT FROM THEIR PLACE, AND VANISH WITHOUT DURATION. IF I HAD UNKNOWN
EVENTS IN MY POSSESSION, I SHOULD THINK WITH GREAT EASE TO OUT-DO THOSE THAT ARE
RECORDED,  IN  ALL  SORTS OF EXAMPLES. IS IT NOT STRANGE THAT EVEN OF THE GREEKS
AND  ROMANS,  WITH  SO  MANY  WRITERS  AND WITNESSES, AND SO MANY RARE AND NOBLE
EXPLOITS,      SO      FEW      ARE      ARRIVED      AT      OUR     KNOWLEDGE:

          "Ad      nos      vix      tenuis      famx      perlabitur     aura."

     ["An   obscure   rumour   scarce   is  hither  come."--AEneid,  vii.  646.]

It  will  be much if, a hundred years hence, it be remembered in general that in
our  times  there  were  civil wars in France. The Lacedaemonians, entering into
battle, sacrificed to the Muses, to the end that their actions might be well and
worthily  written,  looking upon it as a divine and no common favour, that brave
acts  should  find  witnesses that could give them life and memory. Do we expect
that  at every musket-shot we receive, and at every hazard we run, there must be
a  register ready to record it? and, besides, a hundred registers may enrol them
whose  commentaries  will  not last above three days, and will never come to the
sight  of  any  one.  We  have not the thousandth part of ancient writings; 'tis
fortune  that  gives them a shorter or longer life, according to her favour; and
'tis  permissible  to  doubt  whether those we have be not the worst, not having
seen  the  rest. Men do not write histories of things of so little moment: a man
must  have  been general in the conquest of an empire or a kingdom; he must have
won  two-and-fifty  set battles, and always the weaker in number, as Caesar did:
ten thousand brave fellows and many great captains lost their lives valiantly in
his  service,  whose names lasted no longer than their wives and children lived:

               "Quos             fama             obscura             recondit."

     ["Whom    an    obscure    reputation    conceals."--AEneid,    v.    302.]

Even those whom we see behave themselves well, three months or three years after
they  have  departed  hence,  are no more mentioned than if they had never been.
Whoever  will  justly consider, and with due proportion, of what kind of men and
of  what  sort  of  actions the glory sustains itself in the records of history,
will  find that there are very few actions and very few persons of our times who
can  there pretend any right. How many worthy men have we known to survive their
own  reputation,  who  have  seen  and suffered the honour and glory most justly
acquired in their youth, extinguished in their own presence? And for three years
of  this  fantastic  and  imaginary  life we must go and throw away our true and
essential  life, and engage ourselves in a perpetual death! The sages propose to
themselves   a  nobler  and  more  just  end  in  so  important  an  enterprise:

          "Recte  facti,  fecisse  merces  est:  officii fructus, ipsum officium
          est."

     ["The  reward  of a thing well done is to have done it; the fruit of a good
     service      is      the     service     itself."--Seneca,     Ep.,     8.]

It  were,  peradventure,  excusable  in  a  painter  or  other  artisan, or in a
rhetorician  or a grammarian, to endeavour to raise himself a name by his works;
but  the  actions of virtue are too noble in themselves to seek any other reward
than  from  their  own  value,  and especially to seek it in the vanity of human
judgments.

If this false opinion, nevertheless, be of such use to the public as to keep men
in  their  duty;  if the people are thereby stirred up to virtue; if princes are
touched to see the world bless the memory of Trajan, and abominate that of Nero;
if  it  moves  them  to  see  the name of that great beast, once so terrible and
feared,  so  freely  cursed  and reviled by every schoolboy, let it by all means
increase,  and  be  as  much as possible nursed up and cherished amongst us; and
Plato,  bending  his whole endeavour to make his citizens virtuous, also advises
them  not to despise the good repute and esteem of the people; and says it falls
out, by a certain Divine inspiration, that even the wicked themselves oft-times,
as  well  by  word  as  opinion,  can  rightly distinguish the virtuous from the
wicked.  This  person  and  his  tutor  are  both marvellous and bold artificers
everywhere  to  add  divine  operations  and  revelations  where  human force is
wanting:

          "Ut  tragici poetae confugiunt ad deum, cum explicare argumenti exitum
          non                                                          possunt:"

     ["As  tragic  poets  fly  to some god when they cannot explain the issue of
     their      argument."--Cicero,      De      Nat.     Deor.,     i.     20.]

and  peradventure, for this reason it was that Timon, railing at him, called him
the  great  forger  of miracles. Seeing that men, by their insufficiency, cannot
pay   themselves  well  enough  with  current  money,  let  the  counterfeit  be
superadded. 'Tis a way that has been practised by all the legislators: and there
is  no  government  that  has not some mixture either of ceremonial vanity or of
false opinion, that serves for a curb to keep the people in their duty. 'Tis for
this  that  most  of  them  have  their  originals  and beginnings fabulous, and
enriched with supernatural mysteries; 'tis this that has given credit to bastard
religions,  and  caused them to be countenanced by men of understanding; and for
this,  that  Numa  and  Sertorius, to possess their men with a better opinion of
them, fed them with this foppery; one, that the nymph Egeria, the other that his
white  hind,  brought  them  all their counsels from the gods. And the authority
that  Numa  gave  to his laws, under the title of the patronage of this goddess,
Zoroaster,  legislator of the Bactrians and Persians, gave to his under the name
of  the  God  Oromazis: Trismegistus, legislator of the Egyptians, under that of
Mercury;  Xamolxis, legislator of the Scythians, under that of Vesta; Charondas,
legislator  of  the  Chalcidians, under that of Saturn; Minos, legislator of the
Candiots,  under  that  of  Jupiter; Lycurgus, legislator of the Lacedaemonians,
under  that  of Apollo; and Draco and Solon, legislators of the Athenians, under
that  of  Minerva.  And every government has a god at the head of it; the others
falsely,  that  truly,  which  Moses set over the Jews at their departure out of
Egypt.  The  religion of the Bedouins, as the Sire de Joinville reports, amongst
other  things,  enjoined a belief that the soul of him amongst them who died for
his  prince,  went into another body more happy, more beautiful, and more robust
than  the  former; by which means they much more willingly ventured their lives:

          "In  ferrum mens prona viris, animaeque capaces Mortis, et ignavum est
          rediturae                        parcere                       vitae."

     ["Men's  minds  are prone to the sword, and their souls able to bear death;
     and  it  is  base  to spare a life that will be renewed." --Lucan, i. 461.]

This is a very comfortable belief, however erroneous. Every nation has many such
examples  of  its  own;  but  this  subject  would require a treatise by itself.

To add one word more to my former discourse, I would advise the ladies no longer
to      call      that      honour      which     is     but     their     duty:

          "Ut  enim  consuetudo  loquitur,  id  solum dicitur honestum, quod est
          populari                        fama                       gloriosum;"

     ["As  custom  puts  it, that only is called honest which is glorious by the
     public        voice."--Cicero,       De       Finibus,       ii.       15.]

THEIR  DUTY  IS  THE MARK, THEIR HONOUR BUT THE OUTWARD
RIND.  NEITHER  WOULD I ADVISE THEM TO GIVE THIS EXCUSE
FOR  PAYMENT  OF  THEIR  DENIAL:  FOR I PRESUPPOSE THAT
THEIR  INTENTIONS,  THEIR  DESIRE,  AND WILL, WHICH ARE
THINGS  WHEREIN  THEIR  HONOUR IS NOT AT ALL CONCERNED,
FORASMUCH  AS NOTHING THEREOF APPEARS WITHOUT, ARE MUCH
BETTER       REGULATED      THAN      THE      EFFECTS:

          "QUX QUIA NON LICEAT, NON FACIT, ILLA FACIT:"

     ["SHE  WHO  ONLY  REFUSES, BECAUSE 'TIS FORBIDDEN,
     CONSENTS."    --OVID,    AMOR.,    II.    4,   4.]

THE  OFFENCE,  BOTH  TOWARDS GOD AND IN THE CONSCIENCE,
WOULD  BE AS GREAT TO DESIRE AS TO DO IT; AND, BESIDES,
THEY  ARE  ACTIONS SO PRIVATE AND SECRET OF THEMSELVES,
AS  WOULD  BE  EASILY ENOUGH KEPT FROM THE KNOWLEDGE OF
OTHERS,  WHEREIN  THE  HONOUR CONSISTS, IF THEY HAD NOT
ANOTHER  RESPECT  TO THEIR DUTY, AND THE AFFECTION THEY
BEAR  TO  CHASTITY,  FOR  ITSELF. EVERY WOMAN OF HONOUR
WILL MUCH RATHER CHOOSE TO LOSE HER HONOUR THAN TO HURT
HER                                         CONSCIENCE.
