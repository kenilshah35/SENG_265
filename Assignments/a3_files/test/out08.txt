                              Call   ME   Ishmael.
                              SoME           years
                              ago--never  mind how
                              long
                              precisely--having
                              little  or  no money
                              in   my  purse,  and
                              nothing   particular
                              to  interest  ME  on

                         shore,  I thought I would
                         sail  about  a little and
                         see  the  watery  part of
                         the  world. It is a way I
                         have  of  driving off the
                         spleen and regulating the
                         circulation.  Whenever  I
                         find  myself growing grim
                         about      the     mouth;

                    whenever it is a damp, drizzly
                    November  in my soul; whenever
                    I  find  myself  involuntarily
                    pausing      before     coffin
                    warehouses,  and  bringing  up

               the  rear  of every funeral I MEet;
               and  especially  whenever  my hypos
               get  such an upper hand of ME, that
               it    requires   a   strong   moral
               principle                        to

          prevent  ME  from  deliberately stepping
          into   the   street,   and  MEthodically
          knocking   people's  hats  off--then,  I
          account  it  high  tiME to get to sea as
          soon as I can. This is my substitute for
          pistol      and     ball.     With     a

     philosophical  flourish  Cato  throws himself
     upon      his      sword;      I      quietly

take  to  the ship. There is nothing surprising in
this. If they but knew it, almost all MEn in their
degree,  soME  tiME  or other, cherish very nearly
the  saME  feelings  towards  the  ocean  with ME.

There  now is your insular city of the Manhattoes,
belted                   round                  by

wharves  as  Indian isles by coral reefs--comMErce
surrounds  it  with  her surf. Right and left, the
streets  take  you waterward. Its extreME downtown
is the battery, where that noble mole is washed by
waves,                                         and

cooled by breezes, which a few hours previous were
out  of  sight  of  land.  Look  at  the crowds of
water-gazers                                there.
