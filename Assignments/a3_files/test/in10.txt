The international standard date notation is
YYYY-MM-DD
where YYYY is the year in the usual Gregorian calendar, MM is the month of the year between 01 (January) 
and 12 (December), and DD is the day of the month between 01 and 31.

For example, the fourth day of February in the year 1995 is written in the standard notation

1995-02-04

Other commonly used notations are e.g. 
02/04/1995, 
04/02/1995, 
04.02.1995, 
04-02-1995, 
4-February-1995, 
and many more. Especially the first two examples are dangerous, because as both are used quite often 
in the U.S. and in Great Britain and both can not be distinguished, it is unclear whether 02/04/1995 means 
1995-04-02 or 1995-02-04. The date notation 2/4/5 has at least six reasonable interpretations (assuming 
that only the twentieth and twenty-first century are reasonable candidates in our life time).
