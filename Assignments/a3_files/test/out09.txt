Attention: SPAM Having 
consulted with my colleagues 
and based on the information 
gathered from the Nigerian 
Chambers of Commerce and industry, 
I have the privilege to request 
for your assistance to transfer 
the sum of SPAM (SPAM) into 
your accounts. We are now ready to 
transfer SPAM and that is where 
you, SPAM, come in. Thanks! Dec. 21, 2018
